## 🚗 Hydrogen Vehicle Challenge – Edmonton Global Simulation Game
Python & Pygame

## 📌 Project Summary
This project simulates the 5000 Hydrogen Vehicle Challenge in partnership with Edmonton Global, designed to educate and engage users on hydrogen-based transportation. Created using Pygame, the game invites players to collect fuel cells, unlock new hydrogen-powered vehicles, and avoid obstacles, all within a fast-paced 5-minute session.

The game was demonstrated in front of real stakeholders and selected to be showcased at the Canadian Hydrogen Convention 2025.

## 🎯 Game Goals
🔋 Collect hydrogen fuel cells to power your vehicle.

🚘 Unlock new hydrogen-powered vehicles (bikes, cars, trucks).

🛠 Strategically build refueling stations across key routes.

🟥 Avoid red obstacles and fuel depletion.

🎯 Reach the deployment goal of 5000 vehicles within 5 minutes.
## 🕹 Gameplay Overview
Start Point: Begin with 1 vehicle and 100 fuel units.

Fuel Cells: Collect them to extend fuel and unlock new vehicle types.

## Vehicles:

🏍 Bikes – Common and quick, moderate score

🚗 Cars – Balanced in frequency and score

🚛 Trucks – Rare, high-scoring units

## Obstacles:

🔴 Barrier Vehicles

🔴 Red Blocks – Colliding ends the game immediately

## Interface Features:

Countdown Timer

Real-time Fuel Bar

Vehicle Tracker (bikes, cars, trucks)

End Screen with results and status

## 🧠 Core Features
Object-Oriented Structure: The player is managed through a class with attributes for fuel, movement, and vehicle control.

Randomized Gameplay: Fuel cells and obstacles appear randomly to enhance replayability.

HUD Integration: Live display of score, time, and game progress.

Smooth Game Loop: Intro screen → Main game → End result screen
